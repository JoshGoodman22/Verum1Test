Nine states currently have laws banning abortion from conception, with three more — Tennessee, Idaho and Texas — set to take effect on Aug. 25. Three states — Georgia, South Carolina and Ohio — have laws banning abortion when fetal cardiac activity is detected, at about six weeks.

But only 16% of Republicans say abortion generally should be “illegal in all cases.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most Republicans said their state should generally allow a pregnant person to obtain a legal abortion if the child would be born with a life-threatening illness (61%), the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest (77%) or if the person’s health is seriously endangered (85%).\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>A majority of Republicans, 56%, also said their state should generally allow abortion at six weeks into a pregnancy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>GOP politicians may begin to face pressure to satisfy their base’s most conservative anti-abortion opponents — they want total abortion bans — and the moderate or independent voter, who is more accepting of abortion at early points in the pregnancy and in extenuating circumstances. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That’s led some candidates to pivot from hard-line positions in their primaries to more diffuse rhetoric ahead of their general election in purple states. In Arizona, the Republican candidate for governor, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-ap-news-alert-arizona-government-and-politics-11e576be5f9f1a3a14e09fdf6d0bd093\">Kari Lake\u003c/a>, who said during the primary that “abortion is the ultimate sin” and abortion pills should be outlawed, punted to the Legislature when asked about the specifics of abortion policy after she won. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When he was running to be Georgia Republicans’ nominee for the U.S. Senate, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-2022-midterm-elections-biden-college-football-entertainment-25161547108762cda4cbdccab9883393\">Herschel Walker\u003c/a> was unequivocal in his support for an outright abortion ban with no exceptions. Now that he is the nominee running in a tight general election contest, he’s more circumspect. When asked plainly whether he’d vote for an absolute prohibition in a Republican-controlled Senate, Walker demurred. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“That’s an ‘if,’” Walker said, telling reporters he won’t entertain such a hypothetical scenario “right now.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Back in Wisconsin, Evers, who is up for reelection this year, has consistently vetoed anti-abortion legislation brought forth in recent years by the Republican legislature. The Republican candidate for governor, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-wisconsin-donald-trump-presidential-election-2020-940633511bb02e422bdc2da94096b0b7\">Tim Michels\u003c/a>, who won the Republican primary last week, said during his campaign that the state’s 1849 law is “an exact mirror” of his position; he doesn’t support exceptions for rape or incest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The July AP-NORC poll showed 55% of moderate and liberal Republicans said abortion in general should be legal in all or most cases and 39% said abortion should be illegal in most cases. Just 5% said abortion should be illegal in all cases.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But even among conservative Republicans, only 24% say abortion should be illegal in all cases; 60% of conservative Republicans said abortion should be illegal in most cases. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The subject is increasingly the focus of ads for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House and Senate this summer, while it’s tapered off in ads for Republican candidates, according to analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project. Democrats are painting Republicans as extreme on abortion, hoping to see the issue win over voters in the midterm elections. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If we want to be relevant to the debate, there’s got to be some negotiation. If we draw a hard line, we may be on the outside looking in in legislative chambers and in Congress,” said Republican strategist Jason Roe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said the overturning of Roe democratizes the process of regulating abortion and it’s up to each state to come to a consensus “where it’s very likely that the true believers on both sides will not get what they want,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, to Dannenfelser, “every single law that’s passed is a gain for the pro-life movement because for almost 50 years, we had nothing,” she said. “It’s more than we had, and so that’s how I look at it.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fingerhut reported from Washington.

It’s not good,” Vance replied, according to a copy of the email obtained by the AP. “I have a minor affiliation with AEI. Thinking about dropping it because of this and other things.” He did.

Among them: the harmful effects of isolation and remote learning on children’s emotional well-being.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:921111348038' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='768fed6a4e71d694ec0694c627d8fdca'>Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>Student mental health \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-california-department-of-education-california-education-depression-c241b8ee0274d6abf946254e3eb8fbf4\">reached crisis levels last year\u003c/a>, and the pressure on schools to figure out solutions has never been greater. Districts across the country are using federal pandemic money to hire more mental health specialists, rolling out new coping tools and expanding curriculum that prioritizes emotional health.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, some parents don’t believe schools should be involved in mental health at all. So-called social-emotional learning, or SEL, has become the latest political flashpoint, with conservatives saying schools use it to promote progressive ideas about race, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-education-ron-desantis-gender-identity-49dfb9a4f63b2497846df8e96fd652cc\">gender and sexuality\u003c/a>, or that a focus on well-being takes attention from academics.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But at schools like Lakewood, educators say helping students manage emotions and stress will benefit them in the classroom and throughout life.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='e51708dfe658473bb8ced2f70c91bf26' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The school, in a farming community an hour’s drive south of Louisville, has used federal money to create “take-a-break” corners in each classroom. Students can rifle through a “self-regulation kit” with tips on deep breathing, squishy stress balls and acupuncture rings, said school counselor Shelly Kerr. The school plans to build a “Reset Room” this fall, part of an emerging national trend to create campus sanctuaries where students can go to decompress and speak with a counselor.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The online student screener Lakewood uses, called Closegap, helps teachers identify shy, quiet kids who might need to talk and would have otherwise gone unnoticed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Closegap founder Rachel Miller launched the online platform in 2019 with a few schools and saw interest explode after the pandemic hit. This year, she said, more than 3,600 U.S schools will be using the technology, which has free and premium versions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We are finally beginning to recognize that school is more than just teaching the kids reading, writing and arithmetic,” said Dan Domenech, executive director of the national School Superintendents Association. Just as free lunch programs are based on the idea that a hungry child can’t learn, more and more schools are embracing the idea that a cluttered or troubled mind cannot focus on schoolwork, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The pandemic magnified the fragility of mental health among American youth, who had been experiencing a rise in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for years, experts say. A recent report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 44% of high school students said they experienced “ \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/su/su7103a3.htm?s_cid=su7103a3_w#T2_down\">persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness\u003c/a> ” during the pandemic, with girls and LGBTQ youth reporting the highest levels of poor mental health and suicide attempts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If a silver lining exists, the pandemic raised awareness of the crisis and helped de-stigmatize talking about mental health, while also bringing attention to schools’ shortcomings in handling it. President Joe Biden’s administration recently announced over $500 million to expand mental health services in the country’s schools, adding to federal and state money that has poured into schools to cope with pandemic-era needs.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Still, many are skeptical schools’ responses are enough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“All of these opportunities and resources are temporary,” said junior Claire Chi, who attends State College Area High School in central Pennsylvania. Last year, her school added emergency counseling and therapy dogs, among other supports, but most of that help lasted a day or two, Chi said. And that’s “not really a mental health investment for students.” This year, the school says it has added more counselors and plans mental health training for all 10th graders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some critics, including many conservative parents, don’t want to see mental health support in schools in the first place. Asra Nomani, a mom from Fairfax County, Virginia, says schools are using the mental health crisis as a “Trojan horse” to introduce liberal ideas about sexual and racial identity. She also worries schools lack the expertise to deal with student mental illness.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Social-emotional well-being has become an excuse to intervene in the lives of children in the most intimate of ways that are both dangerous and irresponsible,” Nomani said, “because they’re in the hands of people who are not trained professionals.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite the unprecedented funding, schools are having trouble hiring counselors, mirroring the shortages in other American industries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Goshen Junior High School in northwest Indiana has been struggling to fill a vacancy of a counselor who left last year, when student anxiety and other behavioral problems were “off the charts,” said Jan Desmarais-Morse, one of two counselors left at the school, with caseloads of 500 students each.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“One person trying to meet the needs of 500 students?” said Desmarais-Morse said. “It’s impossible.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students per school counselor, which few states come close to meeting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For the 2020-21 school year only two states — New Hampshire and Vermont — achieved that goal, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Center for Education Statistics. Some states face staggeringly high ratios: Arizona averages one counselor to 716 students; in Michigan, 1 to 638; and in Minnesota, 1 to 592.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Also in Indiana, the School City of Hammond won a grant to hire clinical therapists at all 17 of its schools but has not been able to fill most of the new jobs, said Superintendent Scott Miller. “Schools are stealing from other schools. There just aren’t enough workers to go around.” And despite more funding, school salaries can’t compete with private counseling practices, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-education-atlanta-8ccb2e5132d56ccc236faf11050ea2df\">which are also overwhelmed\u003c/a> and trying to hire more staff.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another challenge for schools: identifying struggling children before they’re in emotional crisis. At the Houston Independent School District, one of the largest in the country with 277 schools and nearly 200,000 students, students are asked each morning to hold up fingers showing how they feel. One finger means a child is hurting deeply; five means she or he feels great.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s identifying your brush fires early in the day,” said Sean Ricks, the district’s senior manager of crisis intervention.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Houston teachers now give mindfulness lessons, with ocean sounds played via YouTube, and a Chihuahua named Luci and a cockapoo named Omi have joined the district’s crisis team.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Grant-funding helped Houston build relaxation rooms, known as Thinkeries, at 10 schools last year, costing about $5,000 each. District data show campuses with Thinkeries, which sport bean bag chairs and warmly colored walls, saw a 62% decrease in calls to a crisis line last year, Ricks said. The district is building more this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the rooms themselves are not a panacea. For the calming rooms to work, schools must teach students to recognize they feel angry or frustrated. Then they can use the space to decompress before their emotions erupt, said Kevin Dahill-Fuchel, executive director of Counseling in Schools, a nonprofit that helps schools bolster mental health services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the last days of summer vacation, a “Well Space” at University High School in Irvine, California, was getting finishing touches from an artist who painted a mural of a giant moon over mountains. Potted succulents, jute rugs, Buddha-like statuettes and a hanging egg chair brought an un-school-like feel. When school starts this week, the room is to be staffed full-time with a counselor or mental health specialist.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The goal is to normalize the idea of asking for help and give students a place to reset. “If they can re-center and refocus,” said Tammy Blakely, the district’s director of student support services, “they can then, after a short break, go back into their classrooms and be prepared for deeper learning.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been updated to restore first name and title of Tammy Blakely, the Irvine, California, director of support services.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>For more back-to-school coverage, visit: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/back-to-school\">https://apnews.com/hub/back-to-school\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gecker reported from San Francisco.

Many conservatives who want to overhaul how judges are selected and do away with the interpretation that the constitution’s right to privacy clause allows for abortion rights see an opportunity in pushing for a convention.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>ARIZONA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The GOP controls both chambers of the state Legislature. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey must leave office in January because of term limits.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Legal uncertainty about two different abortion laws prompted clinics to stop providing the procedure. Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich has asked a judge to lift a decades-old order that blocks enforcement of an abortion ban passed before Arizona was a state. But a new law scheduled to take effect Sept. 24 would be less stringent, banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Also after the Dobbs ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court began allowing the state to enforce a 2021 ban on abortions done solely because the fetus has a genetic abnormality such as Down syndrome. But a federal judge in Phoenix in July blocked enforcement of another part of that so-called “personhood” law that grants legal rights to fertilized eggs or fetuses.

The law also prohibits local governments from denying, restricting, or depriving individuals of an abortion. State law still prohibits public funding for abortions and requires that minors inform their parents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Republican lawmakers in Colorado have spoken about legislative challenges to the new state law.

It created a legal cause of action for providers and others sued in another state, enabling them to recover certain legal costs. It also limits the governor’s discretion to extradite someone accused of performing an abortion, as well as participation by Connecticut courts and agencies in those lawsuits.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal in Connecticut until viability, generally considered to be around 24 weeks.

After the ruling, the state adopted another law allowing physician assistants, certified nurse practitioners and nurse midwives to perform abortions before viability that includes legal protections for providers and patients.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal until viability.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions?

Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The D.C. Council is considering legislation that would declare Washington, D.C., a “sanctuary city” for those coming from states where abortion is banned. But because Congress has oversight power over D.C. laws, a future ban or restrictions remain possible depending on control of Congress.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>FLORIDA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Republicans control the House and Senate and governor’s office, with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis pledging to “expand pro-life protections” after the Dobbs decision.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Florida’s new 15-week abortion ban law went into effect July 1. The law is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit from abortion providers in Florida but remains in effect.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: The Florida law prohibits abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions if the procedure is necessary to save the pregnant woman’s life, prevent serious injury or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. It does not allow exceptions in cases where pregnancies were caused by rape, incest or human trafficking. Violators could face up to five years in prison. Physicians and other medical professionals could lose their licenses and face administrative fines of $10,000 for each violation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The lawsuit against Florida’s 15 week ban is ongoing and is expected to eventually reach the state Supreme Court.

There are exceptions in cases of rape – if a police report is filed – and incest. There are exceptions if a woman’s life or health would be threatened.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Some Republican lawmakers and candidates want Georgia to go further and ban abortion entirely, but Gov. Brian Kemp is unlikely to call a special session before November’s general election. Lawmakers are likely to consider further action when they return for their annual session in January. A major factor is whether Kemp is reelected or unseated by Democrat Stacey Abrams in November’s election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>HAWAII\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Hawaii’s governor is a Democrat and Democrats control more than 90% of the seats in the state House and Senate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: The law hasn’t changed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Hawaii legalized abortion in 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade. The state allows abortion until a fetus would be viable outside the womb. After that, it’s legal if a patient’s life or health is in danger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Democratic lawmakers are considering how they might protect Hawaii medical workers from prosecution or civil litigation from other states for treating residents who aren’t full-time Hawaii residents such as military dependents or college students. Policymakers are paying attention to how the state may increase access to abortion on more rural islands where there is a doctor shortage, for example by boosting training for some nurses who under a new law passed last year are allowed to perform first-trimester abortions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>IDAHO\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Republicans hold supermajorities in the House and Senate and oppose access to abortion, as does the state’s Republican governor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: The ruling triggered a ban on all abortions except in cases of reported rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life. It is to take effect Aug. 25. President Joe Biden's administration has sued over the measure, arguing that it conflicts with a federal law requiring doctors to provide pregnant women with medically necessary treatment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Current law allows abortions up to viability, around 24 weeks, with exceptions to protect the woman’s life or in case of nonviable fetuses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The Idaho Supreme Court is expected to rule in August on whether to lift an injunction that blocked enforcement of a law that could subject medical providers who perform abortions to lawsuits and criminal charges.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>ILLINOIS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Illinois is overwhelmingly Democratic with laws providing greater access to abortion than most states. Democrats hold veto-proof supermajorities in the House and Senate, and the Democratic first-term governor seeking reelection this year, J.B. Pritzker, has promoted peaceful protests to protect the right to an abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: No major policy changes. Pritzker has called for a special legislative session to expand abortion rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal in Illinois to the point of viability, and later to protect the patient’s life or health.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: A possible expansion of abortion access rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>INDIANA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Indiana has a Republican-dominated Legislature and a GOP governor who favors restricting abortion access.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: On Aug. 5, Indiana became the first state in the nation to approve such legislation banning abortions since the Supreme Court's ruling. The ban, which takes effect next month, includes some exceptions. Abortions will be permitted in cases of rape and incest, before 10-weeks post-fertilization; to protect the life and physical health of the mother; and if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. Victims of rape and incest won’t be required to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to an attack, as had once been proposed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion in Indiana is currently legal up to about 20 weeks, with tighter restrictions after 13 weeks. Federal judges have lifted several previous injunctions — including abortions based on disability, gender, and race. Indiana doctors must also report abortions they perform on patients under 16 and procedures with complications.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The new ban takes effect Sept. 15.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>IOWA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Iowa has a Republican governor and Republicans have large majorities in both legislative chambers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Kim Reynolds has asked state courts to reverse earlier decisions following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling and an Iowa Supreme Court decision that found the state constitution doesn’t guarantee the right to an abortion. Among the cases is a law she signed but was blocked by a district court that would have banned abortion once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo or fetus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: A law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy remains in effect while Reynolds pursues the tougher ban in court, as does a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions?: Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Reynolds says she will wait for the courts to act on her request to reverse previous rulings before proposing additional restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>KANSAS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Kansas has a Legislature controlled by Republicans who want to ban or restrict access to abortions but a Democratic governor who supports access and is up for reelection this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Kansas voters on Aug. 2 rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have given lawmakers the authority to restrict or ban abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Kansas allows abortion until the 22nd week of pregnancy. After that, abortion is allowed only to save a patient’s life or to prevent “a substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.” Stricter laws are on hold after a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling that the state’s constitution grants a fundamental right to abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortion? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The constitutional amendment vote was the first of its kind in the U.S. since the Dobbs ruling, and it's likely to have activists on both sides across the country recalibrating their strategies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>KENTUCKY:\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Republicans have super majorities in the Kentucky House and Senate, and the GOP passed a trigger law in 2019 that imposed a near-total abortion ban. Kentucky’s Democratic governor opposes the ban and notes that it doesn’t provide exceptions for rape or incest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: On Aug. 1, the state court of appeals threw out an injunction from a lower court that blocked Kentucky's abortion ban, allowing it to go into effect. On Aug. 18, the Supreme Court declined to reinstate the injunction. \u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is mostly banned in the state.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The state’s highest court has agreed to hear abortion clinics’ challenge to the constitutionality of the abortion ban, as well as a ban on abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected. Kentuckians are set to vote in November on a constitutional amendment that would ensure there are no state constitutional protections for abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>LOUISIANA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Louisiana’s Legislature is controlled by Republicans who passed a trigger law to ban most abortions. Its Democratic governor, who is Catholic, also opposes abortions, though he supports exceptions for victims of rape or incest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Immediately after the ruling, Louisiana’s three abortion clinics halted abortion procedures as the trigger law went into effect. However, since then, the ban has taken effect and been blocked multiple times in the form of rulings and temporary restraining orders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: The ban is currently being enforced. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Louisiana Supreme Court that would have blocked the ban for a third time, but were denied Friday, Aug. 12.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: A state district judge’s order gives attorneys until Aug. 20 to develop plans for a trial on whether the law should be permanently blocked. In Louisiana, where the Legislature has long been dominated by abortion opponents, there is little question that an abortion ban will eventually be in effect.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MAINE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Both chambers of the Maine Legislature, which has adjourned, are controlled by Democrats and the state has a Democratic governor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Janet Mills has signed an executive order that bars state agencies from cooperating with other states’ abortion investigations and says extradition attempts in those cases would be denied.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: A 1993 law signed by a Republican governor affirms the right to abortion before the fetus is viable. Abortion is allowed after viability if the health or life of the patient is at risk, or if the pregnancy is no longer viable. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other medical professionals may perform abortions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: No major changes are expected unless Republican former Gov. Paul LePage unseats Mills in her reelection bid and Republicans take control of both chambers of the Legislature.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MARYLAND\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Maryland’s General Assembly is controlled by Democrats who expanded abortion access this year by ending a restriction that only physicians can provide them and requiring most insurance plans to cover abortion care without cost. The legislature overrode Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s veto of the bill in April.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Nothing changed immediately.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: State law prohibits restrictions to abortion prior to viability. The state approved legislation in 1991 to protect abortion rights if the U.S. Supreme Court ever restricted access; voters approved that right in 1992. Some nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants already have received training on medication abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Hogan, who will leave office due to term limits in January, has said he will not advance state funds to train non-physicians to provide abortions before it’s required next year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MASSACHUSETTS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Democrats control the Massachusetts Legislature and support access to abortion, as does the state’s Republican governor, although they differ on specific policies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Charlie Baker signed an executive order on June 24 barring state agencies from assisting another state’s investigation into people or businesses for receiving or delivering reproductive health services that are legal in Massachusetts. The state also won’t cooperate with extradition requests from other states pursuing criminal charges. Just over a month later, Baker signed into law a measure intended to protect access to abortion and expand access to emergency contraceptives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Recent changes to Massachusetts law allows abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases where the child would not survive after birth, and lowers from 18 to 16 the age at which women can seek an abortion without consent from a parent or guardian.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: In liberal Massachusetts, restrictions are unlikely to be adopted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MICHIGAN\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Both chambers of Michigan’s Legislature are controlled by Republicans who want to ban or restrict abortion access. The Democratic governor, who is up for reelection this year, supports access.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Abortion remains legal in Michigan after a state judge issued a preliminary injunction in May blocking immediate enforcement of a 1931 law banning nearly all abortions. Michigan’s Legislature has appealed the decision. Abortion rights activists have taken steps to bring a constitutional amendment before voters on the November ballot. The amendment would affirm the right to make pregnancy-related decisions without interference, including about abortion and reproductive services such as birth control.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: The May temporary injunction, which stems from a Planned Parenthood lawsuit, blocked the 1931 law from going into effect and has kept abortion legal for now. The Michigan Court of Appeals suddenly changed course and said county prosecutors weren’t covered by the injunction and could enforce the ban. But another judge stepped in and said prosecutors — for now — must not follow the prohibition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The state's election bureau and board of canvassers still need to verify and validate that the Reproductive Freedom for All ballot initiative submitted at least 425,000 valid signatures before the constitutional amendment officially makes the ballot. The issue is also expected to shape legislative and statewide elections this fall; the Democratic governor and attorney general have made abortion rights a centerpiece of their reelection campaigns.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MINNESOTA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Anti-abortion Republicans control the Senate and Democrats hold the House, but the majorities are slim. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz is stressing his support for abortion rights as he seeks another term.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Minnesota abortion clinics are starting to see a surge of out-of-state patients. On July 11, a state judge further eased access to abortion by striking down as unconstitutional several restrictions such as a 24-hour waiting period and parental notification.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: A Minnesota Supreme Court ruling from 1995 says the state constitution protects abortion rights. Minnesota allows abortions up to the point of viability, typically 24 weeks. However, some legal experts have questioned whether that cutoff would stand up in court.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Democrats are making abortion rights a major issue as they seek to hold the governor’s office and House and take control of the Senate. Some Republican candidates are notably trying to downplay the issue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MISSISSIPPI\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Mississippi’s Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican governor have pushed for years to ban or restrict access to abortions. A 2018 Mississippi law to ban abortions after 15 weeks was the basis of the case that the U.S. Supreme Court used to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Mississippi’s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, did its final abortions July 6 and has permanently closed. The clinic owner said she is selling the building and the clinic’s lawyers have withdrawn a lawsuit challenging a trigger law that bans most abortions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: The trigger law passed in 2007 is in effect. It allows abortions only if a patient's life is in danger or if a pregnancy was caused by a rape that was reported to law enforcement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn says he will oppose any effort to allow abortion for pregnancies caused by incest because he believes life begins at conception.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MISSOURI\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Both GOP Gov. Mike Parson and the Republican-led General Assembly support laws against abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A 2019 trigger ban on most abortions went into effect.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: The ban makes abortions illegal “except in cases of medical emergency.” Performing illegal abortions is punishable by 5 to 15 years in prison.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The city of St. Louis proposed a $1 million fund to help residents travel to neighboring Illinois for abortions, but Missouri Attorney General Schmitt has sued to block it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MONTANA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The Republicans who control the Montana Legislature and Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte want to limit access to abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: The Montana Republican Party updated its party platform to say it opposes all elective abortions. The party rejected a proposal to include an exception for rape or incest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion used to be legal in Montana up until viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy, but the state Legislature passed a bill in 2021 to reduce that to 20 weeks. That law, along with one that requires chemical abortions to be done with in-person medical supervision, are being challenged in court. A state judge temporarily blocked enforcement in October 2021 while the challenges move through the courts. The Montana Supreme Court on Aug. 9 upheld the temporary injunction. Justices also denied the state’s motion to overturn a 1999 Montana Supreme Court opinion that found the state’s constitutional right to privacy guarantees a woman’s access to abortion care. The justices said they would not take up the merits of the case while ruling on a preliminary injunction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The Montana Legislature passed a referendum to ask voters this November whether they support a state law to require abortion providers to give lifesaving treatment to a fetus that is born alive after a botched abortion. Opponents argue federal law already offers those protections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEBRASKA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Nebraska has a Republican governor who favors a full abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. The officially nonpartisan one-chamber Legislature is dominated by lawmakers who identify as Republicans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Nebraska law has not changed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Nebraska. Those seeking an abortion must receive counseling and wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. People under 19 must have parental consent to undergo an abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Gov. Pete Ricketts remains noncommittal about calling a special session to address abortion, despite many Republican lawmakers pushing to outlaw the procedure. Abortion opponents don’t appear to have the 33-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster waged by abortion-rights supporters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEVADA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Nevada’s governor and state attorney general are Democrats who are up for reelection this year. Democrats control the state Senate and Assembly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Abortion has become a campaign issue in top state and federal races, and Gov. Steve Sisolak has signed an executive order to protect access to abortion for residents and those from other states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Nevada voters enshrined the right to abortion in state law in 1990. A pregnancy can be terminated during the first 24 weeks, and after that to preserve the life or health of the pregnant person. It would take a statewide vote to change or repeal the law. Most Republican candidates for statewide posts say they oppose abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Anti-abortion advocates are not expected to try to repeal Nevada’s abortion law. They have said they’ll seek laws requiring waiting periods, mandatory counseling or parental consent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEW HAMPSHIRE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: New Hampshire has a Republican governor and the GOP controls the 424-member Legislature. All legislative seats are up for election in November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Legislative Democrats have urged Gov. Chris Sununu, who calls himself “pro-choice” to call a special session to codify abortion rights in state law. Sununu and Republican legislative leaders say there’s no need.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Under a law that went into effect this year, abortion is allowed until 24 weeks of pregnancy, later for the health or life of the patient or if the fetus has been diagnosed with “abnormalities incompatible with life.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortion? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Republican lawmakers are divided over whether the state should further restrict abortions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEW JERSEY\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Democrats control both houses of the state Legislature. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy started his second consecutive term this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A week after the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, Murphy signed into law two bills aimed at protecting the right to abortion for out-of-state residents and barring extradition to states that have prohibited the procedure. The governor also signed a state budget that includes $45 million to expand family planning and abortion services and security upgrades for clinics. Acting Attorney General Matthew Platkin and U.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger of New Jersey on July 20 announced a partnership to share intelligence about threats to clinics and patients.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions: Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The state’s Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness is preparing to distribute money from the $5 million Reproductive Health Security Grant program.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEW MEXICO\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The Democrats who control the New Mexico Legislature support access to abortion, as does the state’s Democratic governor. Several conservative Democratic state senators who voted against the repeal of the abortion ban in 2019 were ousted from office in 2020 by more socially progressive primary challengers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Soon after the ruling, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order protecting abortion access. The order seeks to block New Mexico providers from being punished in other states for providing abortions to residents of other states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal in New Mexico, even in the third trimester.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions: Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The owner of the Jackson Women’s Health Organization at the center of the Dobbs decision plans to open a clinic in the city of Las Cruces, near Texas. Conservative counties are considering anti-abortion resolutions that say clinics are not welcomed. Abortion has taken center stage in the gubernatorial campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NEW YORK\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The Democrats who control the New York Legislature support access to abortion, as does the state’s Democratic governor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Kathy Hochul announced $25 million to expand access to abortion services and $10 million in grants to provide security at clinics. Less that two weeks before Dobbs, she signed other measures intended to protect abortion access.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, and after that to preserve the patient’s life or health or if the fetus isn’t viable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Some abortion rights advocates are pushing lawmakers to begin the process of passing a constitutional amendment to protect access to abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NORTH CAROLINA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the state’s General Assembly. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper supports abortion rights, but his veto power could be nullified if Republicans win more seats in November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A federal judge reinstated a 20-week abortion ban on Aug. 17, saying the U.S. Supreme Court decision erased the legal foundation for his 2019 ruling that had blocked its enforcement. Meanwhile, Cooper signed an executive order that shields out-of-state abortion patients from extradition and prohibits state agencies from assisting other states’ prosecutions of those who travel to North Carolina for the procedure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortions in North Carolina are no longer legal after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for urgent medical emergencies that would endanger a pregnant woman's life or “gravely impair” her health. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Republican lawmakers say a successful election season could open the door to further abortion restrictions when the General Assembly reconvenes early next year. The GOP needs to gain five additional seats in November for a veto-proof supermajority. Cooper and other Democrats are making abortion rights a key campaign issue. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>NORTH DAKOTA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: North Dakota has a legislature dominated by Republicans who want to ban abortion, and the GOP governor had wanted Roe v. Wade wiped off the books in favor of state’s rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: The ruling triggered a 2007 law to ban most abortions, but a judge blocked enforcement on July 27, the day before it was to kick in.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Under current law, abortions are legal in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and after that in the case of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the patient.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The state’s only clinic, the Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, is fighting implementation of the ban and plans to move to Moorhead, Minnesota, if abortion is outlawed. The order putting enforcement on hold gave the clinic a reprieve.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>OHIO\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, an abortion opponent, is seeking reelection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A ban on abortions after the first detectable fetal cardiac activity has taken effect. Clinics dropped a federal lawsuit challenging the law and have filed a challenge under the Ohio Constitution. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost is fighting them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: A law prohibiting most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected except when the patient’s life is threatened or their health is at significant risk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Republican lawmakers will move for a total abortion ban after the November election. Some support recently introduced legislation declaring “personhood” begins at conception. Statehouse plans may change if the Ohio Supreme Court allows the clinics’ state constitutional challenge to proceed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>OKLAHOMA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Republicans in Oklahoma have a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and a Republican governor up for reelection this year who has vowed to sign “every pro-life legislation that came across my desk.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Abortion services were halted in the state in May after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a law blocking all abortions with few exceptions. The ruling also triggered a 1910 law that makes it a felony, punishable by two to five years in prison, to perform an abortion or for anyone “advising” or using any “other means whatever” to help a woman obtain an abortion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortions are banned except to protect the life of a patient. Current laws carry civil penalties, as well as criminal penalties for those who perform an abortion or help a woman get one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: A separate criminal statute takes effect on Aug. 27 that makes it a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000, to perform an abortion, with an exception only to save the life of the pregnant woman.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>OREGON\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The Democrats who control the Oregon Legislature support access to abortion, as does the state’s Democratic governor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Kate Brown has said she will protect abortion access for all.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Oregon does not have any major abortion restrictions and it is legal at all stages of pregnancy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Democratic lawmakers have formed a group to make recommendations to expand access to all forms of reproductive care.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>PENNSYLVANIA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Republicans who control the Pennsylvania Legislature are hostile to abortion rights, but the state’s Democratic governor is a strong supporter and has vetoed three GOP-penned bills in five years. The race for governor this year could tilt that balance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: No changes in the law or major court battles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Pennsylvania allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: In November, voters will decide on a new governor between the state’s Democratic attorney general, Josh Shapiro, who supports abortion rights, and Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who supports banning abortion with no exceptions. The Legislature is expected to remain in Republican hands. The state Supreme Court is considering a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers aiming to overturn a 1982 law that bans the use of state dollars for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Republican lawmakers are advancing a proposal to amend the state constitution to declare there is no constitutional right to an abortion or to public funding for an abortion. The proposal could go before voters as early as May 2023.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>RHODE ISLAND\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Democrats who control Rhode Island’s General Assembly support access to abortion, as does the Democratic governor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Daniel McKee signed an executive order prohibiting state agencies from cooperating with other states’ investigations into people who travel to Rhode Island for abortions or health care providers that perform them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: A 2019 law enshrined abortion protections in the state. The law says Rhode Island cannot restrict abortion prior to fetal viability or after if it is necessary to protect the health or life of the patient.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Legislative leaders have said they would address abortion insurance coverage for state employees and people in the Medicaid program in 2023.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>SOUTH CAROLINA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans, but they are a few seats short of a two-thirds majority. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is up for reelection and Democratic opponent Joe Cunningham has said his veto of any stricter abortion bill would likely stick.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: The state’s 2021 ban on abortion once cardiac activity is detected — typically around six weeks after fertilization — took effect but was temporarily blocked by the state Supreme Court on Aug. 17 as justices consider its compliance with the state constitution. A Republican-dominated special House committee is working on a bill to ban all abortions unless the life of the mother is at risk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: With the South Carolina ban on abortion after an ultrasound detects cardiac activity temporarily blocked, the state now permits abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the life of a pregnant woman, or if there is a \"fetal anomaly.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Lawmakers are planning special sessions to consider stricter abortion laws.

Republican Gov. Kristi Noem is up for reelection this year and is an ardent opponent of abortion rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A trigger law took effect banning abortion in South Dakota except to save the life of a pregnant woman. Some conservatives had wanted to do more, including trying to stop organizations or companies from paying for women to travel out of state for an abortion, but Noem – who had initially been eager to call a special session – announced in July that any action could wait until the regular session in 2023. Meanwhile, abortion rights supporters are considering a possible campaign for a ballot initiative aimed at overturning the state abortion ban or making it less restrictive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is illegal in South Dakota except to save the life of the mother.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Possible legislative action in 2023 aimed at making it more difficult for South Dakota residents to obtain abortion care elsewhere. Abortion rights supporters may to take the issue directly to voters to undo the ban.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TENNESSEE\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Tennessee has a Republican governor who is consistently vocal about his opposition to abortion. The GOP holds a supermajority in the General Assembly and has steadily chipped away at abortion access. Voters approved an amendment in 2014 declaring that the state constitution does not protect or secure the right to abortion or require it to be funded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A court allowed enforcement of a law, adopted in 2020, that bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: The so-called “heartbeat” ban has exceptions only to prevent death or major health risks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Most are not.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: An even more stringent ban triggered by the Dobbs ruling is to take effect in late August.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TEXAS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The GOP has commanding majorities in the Texas Legislature and has controlled every statewide office for nearly 30 years. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is up for reelection in November and is favored to win a third term.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: The fall of Roe put in motion a trigger law to ban virtually all abortions starting in August. In the meantime, there has been litigation over whether a 1925 state abortion ban can be enforced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: A 2021 law bans abortions once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, normally around six weeks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? No.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: There are legal questions to be settled about which ban is in effect, but nearly all abortions are expected to be illegal soon in the nation’s second most populous state. Some Republican lawmakers are also looking for ways to punish companies that help Texas-based employees get abortions elsewhere, although it’s not clear how much support that would have in the 2023 legislative session.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>UTAH\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Utah is deeply conservative and the Legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority. \u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: A trigger law banning nearly all abortions was put into effect and then paused by a court amid a legal challenge. Meanwhile, a court allowed a 2021 ban on abortions after 18 weeks to be enforced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortions after 18 weeks are banned except in cases of rape and incest if those crimes are reported to law enforcement, and if there's a serious risk to the life or health of the mother, as well as confirmed lethal birth defects.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: A court will decide whether the near-total ban is allowed under Utah’s state constitution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>VERMONT\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: Democrats control both the House and Senate of the Vermont Legislature. Republican Gov. Phil Scott is a firm supporter of abortion rights.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Vermont has doubled down on its commitment to abortion rights. In 2019, the Vermont Legislature passed a law guaranteeing abortion rights in anticipation of the possible overturning of Roe. At the same time, the state began the process of amending the state constitution to protect abortion rights. The proposal must be passed by two consecutively elected legislatures, a process that was completed in February 2022. The final step in the process is a statewide referendum, scheduled for November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: The vote on the Reproductive Liberty Amendment will be held Nov. 8.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WASHINGTON\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: The Democrats who control the Washington Legislature support access to abortion, as does the state’s Democratic governor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s happened since Dobbs: Gov. Jay Inslee issued a directive barring the Washington State Patrol from cooperating with other state’s investigations related to abortions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal in Washington until viability, and after in cases where the patent’s health or life is threatened.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s next: Democratic officials say they’ll keep looking for ways to preserve access to abortion services for people within the state and who travel from places with restrictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WEST VIRGINIA\u003c/p>\u003cp>Political control: West Virginia’s Legislature is controlled by Republicans who want to ban or restrict access to abortions. Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, opposes abortion access and has signed two anti-abortion laws since taking office in 2017.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What's happened since Dobbs: The state's only abortion clinic initially closed out of concern that the staff could be prosecuted under an abortion law that dates to the 1800s. But the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, in Charleston, announced it would challenge the law and resumed offering abortions. The state's House of Delegates on July 27 passed a sweeping abortion ban that the Senate amended two days later. The House rejected those amendments and sent the bill to a conference committee. Both chambers adjourned but could be called back in August.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Abortion is legal in the first 20 weeks of gestation, longer in cases where the patient's life or health is at risk. Other restrictions include a 24-hour waiting period, required counseling to discourage abortion, parental permission for minors; a ban on the use of telemedicine to administer a medication abortion; and prohibition of abortions on the grounds that the child will be born with a disability.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions? Yes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What's next: Whether the old nearly total ban can be enforced is playing out in courts.

Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has filed a lawsuit in state court challenging the ban. He argues that a 1985 state law prohibiting abortion after a fetus can survive outside the womb trumps the older law. While that lawsuit is pending, anti-abortion groups have said they will work with the Republican-controlled Legislature next year to update or replace the 1849 law.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What’s in effect: Possibly the 1849 ban on all abortions except to save a woman’s life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Clinics offering abortions?

Glink now leads the Irving Harris Foundation, which, while still giving millions of dollars in early-childhood grants each year, is no longer the biggest donor on the scene. The Early Childhood Funders Collaborative counts nearly 60 national, state, and local foundations as members.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While grantmakers have historically put more resources into elementary and secondary education than early childhood, support for the youngest learners is on the rise. From 2006 to 2013, foundations over all gave at least $4.6 billion to support early-childhood education, according to data from Candid. From 2014 to 2021, that sum grew to $7.1 billion.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>As more donors have contributed, they’ve found new ways to link arms and help more people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Grantmakers now support the child-care and educator workforce through the Early Educator Investment Collaborative and home-based child-care providers through Home Grown. Collaboratives, including Blue Meridian and Pediatrics Supporting Parents, have zeroed in on well-child appointments in the pediatrician’s office as a key moment to support healthy social and emotional development. Dozens of foundations have pooled their resources through organizations such as Alliance for Early Success and the First Five Years Fund, advocacy groups working to get more government funding at the state and federal levels.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:945651528701' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='545670b2e1119e6c40f719c46cb531a4'>Hub peek embed (Philanthropy) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>This coming together is part of a larger trend. Research from the Bridgespan Group found that the pace of establishing pooled grantmaking funds of all kinds has accelerated in recent years, and their giving potential could be exponentially greater. A 2021 survey of 97 pooled funds estimated their grantmaking totaled $2 billion to $3 billion in 2020. Collectively, they estimated that they could distribute up to $15 billion a year with minimal growth in current staffing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of the reasons there has been so much collaboration among early-childhood donors? The size of the challenge is massive, says Shannon Rudisill, executive director of the Early Childhood Funders Collaborative, which operates a pooled fund to support grassroots groups that advocate for more quality education and care for all youngsters.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“In this country, we have chosen not to prioritize or invest in this. We don’t have paid family leave for people when they have babies. We don’t have economic supports for families when they’re young. We don’t have adequate child care when it’s time to go to work,” Rudisill says. “We are woefully undercommitted to a public system of support for young kids and families.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For that reason, she says, “what any one funder can do is going to have some limits.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Working together might range from multimillion-dollar grantmaking efforts and pooled funds to less structured arrangements where funders come together to learn.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The eight foundations involved in the Early Educator Investment Collaborative, for example, are working to reimagine the system of teacher qualifications and preparation in a way that supports and builds on its existing diversity. The early-education work force is predominantly female and disproportionately women of color. The average hourly wage is just $14.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The collaborative has funded research that examines how systemic racism in the United States has influenced early-childhood education policy, with a particular focus on improving workforce stability and educator pay.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It has also made seven grants totaling $11.3 million to colleges and universities, with a focus on those that serve marginalized populations or that partner with two-year community colleges, to help them strengthen programs that prepare early-childhood teachers. Among other things, grantees are revising curricula to offer certificates in multiple languages and trying skills assessments focused on observing educators’ competency in the classroom as opposed to only using proficiency tests.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“When you do an individual grant, you have to pick one aspect of that big problem and address it. But collectively, if we can get six to eight institutions of higher education to be successful in developing these kinds of programs, that begins to have an influence on the field of higher education and the early-childhood world,” says Jessie Rasmussen, president of the Buffett Early Childhood Fund, a member of Early Educator Investment Collaborative. “That’s the beauty of coming together.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A couple of groups of donors have set their sights on the pediatrician’s office as a key place to connect with nearly every child.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pediatrics Supporting Parents — made up of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the Einhorn Collaborative, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, the Overdeck Family Foundation, and the Perigee Fund — aims to nurture children’s social and emotional development by improving the quality of the doctor’s appointments over the first three years of a child’s life.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The group, founded in 2017, spent three years identifying a set of successful practices — such as providing ongoing physician training and helping build parents’ confidence through feedback that affirms positive interactions with their child.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The foundations created a donor-advised fund for joint grant making that will apply the common practices in several regions. They’ve also written policy papers detailing how Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program — which provide health insurance for nearly half of children under age 3 — could finance care that’s more supportive of a child’s development.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One effort the collaborative supports, the HealthySteps program — part of the nonprofit Zero to Three — which places early-childhood-development specialists in pediatric primary care practices. The specialists join routine appointments to help answer parents’ questions, conduct developmental and mental health screenings, and help tell families about other resources. The goal is to ensure that young children reach important early developmental and social-emotional milestones.\u003c/p>\u003cp>HealthySteps got its start 26 years ago when New York philanthropist Bernard Levy gave $25,000 to Zero to Three. The program was tried in a few locations around the country. But while parents and pediatricians said they loved it, and external evaluations offered evidence of the program’s positive impact on early learning and development, the idea did not attract government funding.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now interest in helping parents and others in the first three years of a child’s life has begun to accelerate and the program is gaining support. As a result of a major cash infusion from the donor collaborative Blue Meridian, which is made up of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, the Duke Endowment, and others, the program has been able to expand significantly in recent years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2018, Blue Meridian gave $39 million to HealthySteps. And earlier this year the collaborative, which now counts MacKenzie Scott and the Valhalla and Zoom foundations among its members, announced an additional $46.5 million investment to expand the program’s reach over the next five years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Today, HealthySteps reaches more than 300,000 babies and young children in 200-plus pediatric offices in 25 states. Matthew Melmed, who leads Zero to Three, says the program is on track to serve 1 million babies a year by 2032.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are many places where grantmakers can help improve the lives of young children, says Glink, of the Irving Harris Foundation. Whether their point of entry is through health care, workforce development, direct service, or state education policy, wherever foundations put their resources, she says, they should know who is working beside them so that they can collaborate effectively.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Changing the systems that support kids, she says, requires “figuring out how to knit and weave what we’re doing together.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>This article was provided to The Associated Press by the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Although they make up only a small percentage of the railroad's more than 30,000 employees, their cases could prove costly to Union Pacific and could hinder the companies' efforts to fill scores of open jobs at a time when all of the nation's railroads are dealing with worker shortages.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former Union Pacific workers have filed at least 15 other federal lawsuits, and more than 200 other complaints are pending with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that are likely to turn into lawsuits. Seven other cases have been settled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The lawsuits were originally going to be part of a class-action case filed by former employees, but a federal appeals court decided in 2020 that the complaints had to be pursued individually. The first few cases have now been tried and verdicts over $1 million have been issued in all three.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>A spokeswoman for the EEOC said it can’t comment on whether it is investigating allegations against Union Pacific. However, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, Jim Kaster, said the EEOC has ongoing investigations of the railroad’s practices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What makes this case so egregious is the planning from the top down,” said Kaster, who helped handle the class-action case. “It is one thing for a rogue manager in a company to discriminate on the basis of disability. This case is different because this company targeted people with disabilities and disqualified them from working without even examining them and many times without even talking to them.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>By the railroad's own count, UP said in arguments in the original class-action lawsuit that some 7,700 employees had to undergo what is called a “fitness-for-duty” review between 2014 and 2018. It's not clear how many of those people were forced out by unworkable restrictions, but lawyers for the plaintiffs estimate nearly 2,000 people faced restrictions that kept them off the job for at least two years if not indefinitely. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Union Pacific policies say that anyone with more than a slight chance of “sudden incapacitation” shouldn't work for the railroad because it's dangerous. The railroad has vigorously defended its policy, arguing its strict rules are designed to protect its workers and the public from injury risks or environmental damage if someone suffers a health emergency that causes a derailment or other accident.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Union Pacific spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said the railroad strives to maintain an inclusive workplace, but “the Americans with Disabilities Act does not diminish Union Pacific’s commitment and obligation to maintain a safe work environment.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Union Pacific medical personnel who have a thorough understanding of a railroad’s unique operational requirements assess employees’ medical condition to determine if it prevents them from safely performing their essential job duties in accordance with our medical standards and obligations under the ADA,” Tysver said. “In addition, Union Pacific often engages third-party medical consultants to assist with medical reviews.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet former workers claim Union Pacific is ignored their doctors' advice and making their own determinations, often when doctors have said an employee is cleared to work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The cases leave Union Pacific potentially facing more than $350 million in damages plus sizeable legal fees, and government regulators could impose additional penalties if they fault the railroad. That may not do much to dent the bottom line for a company that reported a $1.84 billion profit in its most-recent quarter, but the lawsuits could add to unrest among its current workers. UP workers are already upset that they haven’t had a raise since 2019 and that the railroad tightened its attendance policy, making it harder to take time off. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Federal law caps most damages in these disability cases besides lost wages at $300,000, but lawyers for the plaintiffs say the giant judgments, including a $44 million decision they won last year in Wisconsin, send a strong message that Union Pacific's policy is flawed even if the penalty is reduced. In the Wisconsin case, a conductor with impaired hearing was forced out despite years of successful employment because he couldn't pass a hearing test while wearing the company's newly required hearing protection. The railroad wouldn't consider alternative protective gear.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The cases all argue that Union Pacific discriminates against people with disabilities because of the way it disqualifies employees after they report certain health conditions, even if they have little bearing on whether an employee can safely do their job. Since 2014, the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad has required workers to report anytime they develop a heart condition, have a seizure or develop diabetes that needs to be treated with insulin. Union Pacific also routinely imposes restrictions on employees who fail a color vision test it designed and refuses to employ someone with a prosthetic limb regardless of how capable they might be.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When an employee or their supervisor reports a health condition, Union Pacific puts them on leave and demands they submit medical records that railroad doctors review to determine their suitability for work. The plaintiffs say the railroad usually makes its decision without doctors examining employees, and Union Pacific ignores the recommendations of doctors who are treating individuals and have cleared them to return to work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>An occupational medicine doctor who works with the plaintiffs, Kevin Trangle, said he doesn't think UP's policy is sound because it's “more restrictive than necessary, and would tend to cause workers to be unnecessarily prevented from working.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rolando Vasquez said in one of the lawsuits he lost his job after he had a motorcycle accident because doctors put him on anti-seizure medication as a precaution. In response, the railroad imposed a series of restrictions that made it impossible for him to work as an electronic technician inspector in Del Rio, Texas, even though he’d never actually had a seizure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In another case, a diesel electrician said he was treated as if he had a condition that causes seizures after he fainted once because he was dehydrated while battling an illness. The railroad ruled that Joseph Carrillo shouldn’t be allowed to operate any company vehicles, work around moving trains or hold any job that involved “critical decision making,” so his managers in El Paso agreed he could no longer repair locomotives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>J.J. Stover lost his job as a track inspector in Kearney, Nebraska, after having a dizzy spell at work because his doctors labeled the 2016 incident a mini stroke, or transient ischemic attack, even though he said all the tests they performed on him while he was hospitalized for more than three days came back negative and he hasn’t experienced any more dizziness.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stover’s doctors said he could return to work just a couple weeks later. Shortly after that, the Army Reserves took his doctors’ word and sent him to Poland for several weeks of training, but Union Pacific spent nine months reviewing his records before deciding he shouldn’t be allowed to drive a railroad truck or work around the tracks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s just hard to understand,” Stover said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another one of the workers’ attorneys, Nick Thompson, said Union Pacific doesn’t seem to consider any mitigating details, and it applies the same restrictions to every worker that has a condition regardless of whether that person drives a train or digs a ditch to install a signal for the railroad.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They treat every condition like it’s the worst version of that. If you pass out — regardless of the cause — they treat it for determining risk of future events as though it is an unmedicated seizure condition. That just doesn’t make any sense,” Thompson said. \u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"apf-Health","name":"Health","canonicalName":"health","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-lifestyle","name":"Lifestyle","canonicalName":"lifestyle","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Omaha","name":"Omaha","canonicalName":"omaha","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"olympicYear":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null,"displayPositionHome":null,"displayPositionApp":null,"featuredCard":null,"publishedDate":"2022-08-18 10:11:28"},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fe2363c2ba6c2c124304daccdbba2d5c","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fe2363c2ba6c2c124304daccdbba2d5c","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"embedCardTitleColor":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:fe2363c2ba6c2c124304daccdbba2d5c","shortId":"fe2363c2ba6c2c124304daccdbba2d5c","bylines":null,"canonicalUrl":"entertainment-health-los-angeles-accidents","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actor Anne Heche died from inhalation injury and burns after her fiery car crash and the death was ruled an accident, according to coroner's results released Wednesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Heche, 53, also had a fractured sternum caused by “blunt trauma,\" according to \u003ca href=\"https://mec.lacounty.gov/case-detail/?caseNumber=2022-08397\">information\u003c/a> on the website of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Anne Heche's death ruled accidental after fiery car crash","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"bbb95c09705246158618f6f3c9050fba","leadVideoId":"3816dc00ec5d44be81ead0feead99232","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/fe2363c2ba6c2c124304daccdbba2d5c","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"bbb95c09705246158618f6f3c9050fba","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - Anne Heche arrives at the premiere of \"The Tender Bar\" at the TCL Chinese Theatre, on Dec. 12, 2021, in Los Angeles.

The team canceled an extra throwing session Lock was supposed to have with DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and others and got him tested. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Carroll said this is the second time Lock has contracted COVID-19 after getting it last year while playing for Denver. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“He barely made it off the field.

This week is a screwed up week for a guy to get a bunch of turns and all that,” Carroll said. “He worked with the ones yesterday in prep for the game and so that’s really all he got.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lock’s five-day quarantine could have him back with the team early next week, but Carroll wouldn’t say if the team will plan for Lock to start the preseason finale at Dallas on Aug. 26. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’ll have to wait and see. Let’s see what happens. We don’t need to make that decision yet,” Carroll said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Carroll also said running back Ken Walker III is undergoing a procedure to repair a hernia, but it’s not a sports hernia or a core muscle injury. Carroll remains optimistic that Walker will be back in time for the season opener on Sept. 12. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"SeattleSeahawks","name":"Seattle Seahawks","canonicalName":"seattle-seahawks","isPr":false},{"id":"NFL","name":"NFL","canonicalName":"nfl","isPr":false},{"id":"Coronaviruspandemic","name":"COVID-19","canonicalName":"coronavirus-pandemic","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-Health","name":"Health","canonicalName":"health","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"Seattle","name":"Seattle","canonicalName":"seattle","isPr":false},{"id":"PeteCarroll","name":"Pete Carroll","canonicalName":"pete-carroll","isPr":false},{"id":"TylerLockett","name":"Tyler Lockett","canonicalName":"tyler-lockett","isPr":false},{"id":"GenoSmith","name":"Geno Smith","canonicalName":"geno-smith","isPr":false},{"id":"DrewLock","name":"Drew Lock","canonicalName":"drew-lock","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"olympicYear":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null,"displayPositionHome":null,"displayPositionApp":null,"featuredCard":null,"publishedDate":"2022-08-17 22:01:23"},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d1807549d5e4442904d98860f217869","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d1807549d5e4442904d98860f217869","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"embedCardTitleColor":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d1807549d5e4442904d98860f217869","shortId":"2d1807549d5e4442904d98860f217869","bylines":"By JAMES POLLARD","canonicalUrl":"abortion-us-supreme-court-health-government-and-politics-south-carolina","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>COLUMBIA, S.C.

He was scheduled to speak at an engine factory Tuesday morning, but federal police officers asked him to cancel the event due to security concerns, according to his campaign. Instead, the leftist launched his seventh bid for the presidency at a Volkswagen plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, a manufacturing city outside Sao Paulo where he rose to fame as a union leader in the 1970s. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bolsonaro revisited the spot in the city of Juiz de Fora where he was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sao-paulo-caribbean-ap-top-news-elections-brazil-c8738209663040b29488f41c0a3fcd48\">stabbed by a mentally ill man on the campaign trail in 2018.\u003c/a> He arrived on a motorcycle surrounded by security guards and wearing a bulletproof vest, unlike in 2018 when he plunged unprotected into the thronging crowd. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Creomar de Souza, founder of political risk consultancy Dharma Politics, told The Associated Press that da Silva’s visit to an auto plant is typical of Brazilian symbolism, evoking nostalgia of his first presidential run in 1989 and hinting at his legacy. De Souza added that he expects candidates to attack one another more than present plans for voters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I want this election to end as soon as possible with Lula winning it, so there’s less risk of violence and more talk about the future,” Vanderlei Cláudio, a metalworker, said at the event.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bolsonaro's return to the site of his stabbing is an attempt to invoke the same outsider profile that enabled the seven-term lawmaker to cruise to victory in 2018, said Maurício Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“For Bolsonaro, this is the image of himself as a rebel, anti-system candidate, and the attack on his life is central to that narrative,\" said Santoro. \"For him and his supporters, the man who stabbed him was not a ‘lone wolf’, but part of a conspiracy of the political elite against Bolsonaro.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The race in Latin America's largest democracy is a clash of titans, with all other candidates lagging far behind. Both have been publicly rallying supporters for months, although they hadn't been permitted by the electoral authority to ask for votes nor air ads. So far, no debates between da Silva and Bolsonaro have been scheduled. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's impossible not to be moved, returning to this city,” Bolsonaro told the crowd in Juiz de Fora, where people were patted down before being allowed past metal barriers to approach the president's stage. “The memory that I carry with me is of a rebirth. My life was spared by our creator.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>After his speech, Bolsonaro made a speedy exit standing on the bed of a truck, waving to the crowd while tightly encircled by security personnel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite the 2018 attempt on Bolsonaro's life, recent events have caused greater concern his supporters could engage in attacks. Bolsonaro backers surrounded da Silva’s car to hurl verbal abuse earlier this year, and in July one of them killed a local official of da Silva's Workers’ Party in the city of Foz de Iguaçu.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Da Silva's supporters have also been targeted. At a rally in June, a drone sprayed a crowd with a fetid liquid, and at another last month a man detonated a homemade explosive containing feces. The assailants in both cases were Bolsonaro supporters, according to social media posts reviewed by AP. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Lula cancelled his first event due to security risks, and that kind of thing has taken over all camps. I don’t think Bolsonaro runs the same risk, but he was stabbed last time,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. “These terrible events are now part of Brazil’s elections, and that matters.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bolsonaro is a staunch pro-gun advocate and has \u003ca href=\"sonaro-arms-base-155641b58c95d6cd7c64bd5d1bd45ca5\">loosened restrictions, enabling his supporters to stock up on firearms and munitions\u003c/a>. At the launch of his candidacy on July 24, he asked supporters to swear they would give their lives for freedom, and has repeatedly characterized the race as a battle of good versus evil. His wife, Michelle, said at that same event that the presidential palace had been consecrated to demons before her husband assumed office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Sao Bernardo do Campo, da Silva rattled off the Bolsonaro administration’s failings during the COVID-19 pandemic — which \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-crime-pandemics-homicide-covid-19-pandemic-1a1f8bf555e837c16dcfeaec111a7d3e\">a Senate investigation found contributed to the world's second-highest death toll\u003c/a> — then said, “If there’s anyone possessed by the devil, it’s that Bolsonaro.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bolsonaro's supporters frequently cite da Silva's 580 days of imprisonment after he was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/673cdce2999040899eaea51e69c120d1\">found guilty of corruption and money laundering.\u003c/a> Those convictions ejected da Silva from the 2018 race and cleared the way for Bolsonaro.
