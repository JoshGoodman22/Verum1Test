The world has perhaps never seen this level of simultaneous agricultural disruption, according to agriculture executives, industry analysts, farmers and economists, meaning it may take years to return to global food security.</p>

The pressure from Tokyo, an influential member of the Group of Seven rich nations, comes as the Japanese auto industry has faced scrutiny from green investors who say it has been slow to embrace zero-emission vehicles and lobbied against regulations that would encourage quicker transition to the technology.</p>

Women are especially vulnerable to rising temperatures in poor countries on the frontlines of climate change because many have little choice but to work through their pregnancies and soon after giving birth. Further adding to the risks, women in socially conservative Pakistan — and many other places —typically cook the family meals over hot stoves or open fires, often in cramped rooms with no ventilation or cooling.<br>The harsh conditions facing many women were brought into tragic focus on May 14, the day temperatures in Jacobabad, Pakistan hit 51 C, making it the world&#8217;s hottest city at that time.&nbsp;</p>

The higher purchases from the United States are expected to support U.S. soy oil prices, which have climbed nearly 20% this year to close to their highest in a decade, fueling worries about food inflation. Soybean futures also rose because of gains in soyoil.</p>

The proposal was presented at an internal board meeting on corporate strategy in October 2020 and was confirmed by Coal India’s chairman, although a critical coal shortage in India now means the first such shipments would be unlikely until the end of this year. </p>

Russia, home of Uralkali and EuroChem potash mines, faces possible economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine. Uralkali and Belarus Potash Company (BPC) together account for more than one-third of global potash sales, according to BMO Capital Markets.</p>
