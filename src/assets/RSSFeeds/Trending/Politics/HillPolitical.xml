										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for those evacuated from Afghanistan, a first attempt to end their legal limbo after nearly a year in the United States.</p>



<p>The Afghan Adjustment Act, if approved by both chambers, could eliminate uncertainty for Afghan evacuees, some who had only a year after arriving in the U.S. to secure a legal pathway to remain in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s critical legislation for more than 70,000 Afghans who were transported to the U.S. before the end of the U.S. withdrawal at the end of August last year.</p>



<p>The bill allows those who were brought to the U.S. during the evacuation or in the year since to apply to become legal permanent residents after either one or two years residing in the country.</p>



<p>“Giving our Afghan allies a chance to apply for permanent legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), one of the bill’s authors, said in a release.</p>



<p>“This bipartisan legislation will help provide these newly arrived Afghans who have sacrificed so much for our country with the legal certainty they deserve as they begin their lives in the U.S. It’s important to do what we can to help our Afghan friends find stability, opportunity, and community in their new home.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The legislation is modeled after other efforts, including bills passed by Congress following the evacuation of allies following the end of the Vietnam War, and retains provisions regarding security vetting.</p>



<p>The bill includes other provisions that aim to aid an estimated over 100,000 Afghans still remaining in the country made vulnerable either by their association with the U.S. or their involvement in various pro-Democracy efforts and human rights campaigns.</p>



<p>It would established an Interagency Task Force on Afghan Ally Strategy to help those who would typically meet the requirements for the U.S. refugee program or qualify for a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) – a visa class reserved for those who assisted the U.S. military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SIV process can take years to complete and requires approval by high-level embassy staff – a process only more complicated with the exit of the U.S. diplomatic corps from Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The task force would be led by the secretary of state, the secretary of homeland security, the secretary of defense, the director of the FBI, and the director of national intelligence.</p>



<p>The bill would also expand those who qualify for the SIV process, adding a number of military units from the Afghan National Army, including Female Tactical Platoon of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Army Special Operations Command.</p>



<p>“It is unlikely that Afghans brought to the United States on temporary status will be able to return to their homes in the near, mid, or even long-term future," Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said in a release. "At the same time, there are allies and vulnerable Afghans who are desperately trying to leave their crumbling nation, and who live under great risk. The United States must ensure that we keep our promises to our Afghan allies, and provide certainty for those who fled to the United States and have no place to return,” </p>



<p>In addition to Klobuchar and Murkowski, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are all original co-sponsors.</p>



<p>A companion bill was filed in the House by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Peter Meijer (R-Mich.).</p>



<p>The introduction of the bill comes after a year of lobbying efforts from various groups warning that Afghans faced an uncertain future and even the risk of deportation without a wide ranging bill to help them adjust their status.</p>



<p>“This vital legislation addresses the legal limbo that tens of thousands of evacuees still face, and offers them the stability and peace of mind they need to thrive in their new communities,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement.</p>



<p>“This is how we stand by those who stood by us. Congress has passed similar legislation for every other modern wartime evacuee population, and we simply cannot finish the mission without enshrining these protections into law.”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Cyber experts are warning against the rapid growth of crypto theft led by North Korean state-sponsored hackers following a series of heists targeting blockchain firms.</p>



<p>Nick Carlsen, a blockchain analyst at TRM Labs, said cyber-enabled financial crimes, especially those allegedly conducted by North Korea, have accelerated over the past few years as the East Asian country has become more sophisticated in stealing virtual currency.</p>



<p>“The threat landscape right now is as bad as I think it has ever been when it comes to financial theft,” Carlsen said&nbsp;during a webinar hosted by the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) on Monday.</p>



<p>Carlsen was referring to a string of crypto heists this year involving hackers stealing millions of dollars worth of digital assets from blockchain firms.</p>



<p>In the last two months, two California-based crypto firms – Harmony and Nomad – lost over $100 million dollars in virtual currency following hacks from unknown perpetrators. Both companies said that they were working with law enforcement to track down the hackers and retrieve the stolen funds.</p>



<p>A senior administration official told reporters on Monday that there have been seven major crypto hacks in 2022, several of which the U.S. ties to North Korea.</p>



<p>The official’s remarks were in response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3592859-treasury-sanctions-crypto-mixer-for-aiding-hackers-laundering-illicit-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treasury Department’s announcement</a>&nbsp;on Monday that it was imposing sanctions on&nbsp;cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash for allegedly helping hackers launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency.</p>



<p>The department said Tornado Cash allowed cyber groups, including North Korean-backed hackers, to use its platform to launder the proceeds of cybercrimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agency also disclosed that the cryptocurrency mixer was used to launder more than $96 million of illicit cyber funds originating from the&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/3536352-hackers-stole-100-million-in-latest-crypto-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harmony bridge heist</a>&nbsp;and at least $7.8 million from the&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/3584512-hackers-stole-nearly-200-million-from-us-crypto-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nomad crypto theft</a>.</p>



<p>The sanctions mean that U.S. entities are forbidden from conducting business with Tornado Cash.</p>



<p>Carlsen said the sanctions against Tornado Cash are “monumental” and a “game changer.” He added that the U.S. has come a long way and is now taking an aggressive stance against cyber criminals exploiting cryptocurrencies for their own gains.</p>



<p>“Shutting down that avenue for criminals to launder money, that’s huge,” Carlsen said, adding that he was eager to see what further actions the U.S. government plans to take when countering crypto-related crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Treasury Department also sanctioned another crypto mixer, Blender.io, in May, alleging that it was being used to launder money from hackers backed by North Korea’s government.</p>



<p>U.S. officials have also been worried about North Korea’s increasing use of crypto theft to&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3590126-north-koreas-increasing-use-of-crypto-heists-to-fund-nukes-worries-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fund its nuclear and missile programs</a>.</p>



<p>Anne Neuberger, the Biden administration’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, recently said that she was “concerned about North Korea’s cyber capabilities,” adding that the country uses “up to a third of [stolen crypto] funds to fund their missile program.”</p>



<p>A United Nations report this year found that between 2020 and 2021, North Korean-backed hackers stole more than $50 million in digital assets to fund the country’s missile program,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60281129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the BBC reported</a>.&nbsp;The U.N. report also revealed that the attacks targeted at least three cryptocurrency exchanges in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>



<p>At the webinar, Carlsen gave a few suggestions on ways the U.S. can be more efficient at countering cyber-enabled financial crimes. He said the U.S. should be more on the offense and proactively disrupt North Korean cyber operations and infrastructure instead of waiting for an incident to occur to then respond.</p>



<p>“That’s something I’d like to see a lot more of,” Carlsen said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also said that there should be increased collaboration between the U.S. and South Korea as they join their cyber forces to combat rising North Korean threats.</p>



<p>“I think [North Korea] has probably gotten used to being in a position of being the hunter and not the hunted,” Carlsen said.</p>



<p>“So, it might be strategically helpful to shift that dynamic a little bit,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If Russia were a business, it would be headed for bankruptcy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Historians will write that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fatal miscalculation was his belief that Europe would cave if he invaded Ukraine because of its excessive dependence on Russian energy. But excessive dependence works both ways: Europe relied on Russian oil and gas, but Russia relied heavily on the European energy market.</p>



<p>Given this co-dependency, Putin would have been well-advised to postpone his predation against Ukraine and his customers in the West until he had secured equivalent energy markets in the East. But he did not. Worse, his weaponization of energy has forced Europeans to find new energy suppliers and fossil fuel replacements. Now they are signing <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60871601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term energy contracts</a>, and Russia cannot replace these customers.</p>



<p>If Russia were a business, it would be headed for bankruptcy. For years, Moscow built pipelines to Europe (through Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Turkey and under the Black and Baltic Seas), but it has not built a single pipeline directly linking Russian oil or gas fields to China, the world’s biggest energy buyer and its avowed ally. Putin’s ballyhooed pronouncements before the war about massive Siberian pipelines to China are years away from completion. And post-war, such projects will be impossible, given Western sanctions and the mass exodus of oil and gas companies from Russia in protest. It was these foreign companies and their expertise that built Russia’s oil and gas sector which, in turn, financed its military buildup. Now their departure will not only strand Russian resources but impede development of Russia’s engine of economic growth indefinitely. To boot, China and others buy Russian energy but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/30/china-snaps-up-russian-coal-at-deep-discounts-as-ukraine-war-continues.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demand deep discounts</a> because they can.</p>



<p>Putin is clueless when it comes to running an economy. Russia has more natural gas reserves than any other nation on Earth, some <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/natural-gas-by-country%20but%20Putin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19.9 percent of the total</a>. But it has failed to capitalize on the liquified natural gas (LNG) revolution underway worldwide, which makes it possible to ship gas anywhere in the world. Gas liquefies if cooled to minus 162 degrees Celsius and its volume shrinks by 600 times into a non-toxic liquid that is easy to store and transport.</p>



<p>One LNG ship, more than three football fields long and carrying five cryogenic tanks, can deliver the equivalent of three days’ gas flow from Russia’s biggest gas pipeline. Currently, an estimated 657 of these tankers criss-cross the oceans constantly, and all oil and gas producing nations are quickly building plants to liquefy their gas and export terminals to re-gasify the LNG for customers around the world. But Russia is years behind the rest.</p>



<p>This year, the United States – with only 6.7 percent of the world’s gas reserves – became the world’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-becomes-top-lng-exporter-first-half-2022-eia-2022-07-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest LNG exporter</a>, in part because of its stepped-up shipments to Europe since the war began. In fact, the United States has overtaken Russia in LNG shipments to China this year, with a market share of <a href="https://globallnghub.com/chinas-lng-imports-can-the-united-states-capture-more-of-the-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 11 percent</a> compared with Russia’s 6 percent. Australia, Qatar, Malaysia and Indonesia have captured the lion’s share of China’s LNG market.</p>



<p>Post-war Europe will transition away from Russian energy altogether because Putin’s blackmail and price shock gambits have created disastrous price hikes and inflation and ruined its reputation as a reliable supplier. European nations currently have 36 LNG ports, and increased their LNG uptake from other suppliers since the war began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/business/liquefied-natural-gas-europe.html#:~:text=European%20imports%20of%20L.N.G.,January%20the%20highest%20on%20record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 50 percent</a>. Dozens more LNG terminals are under construction, and massive gas supply contracts have been signed by European nations, with Azerbaijan, Algeria, Saudi Arabia as well as with the United States, Australia, Qatar, Nigeria and Norway.</p>



<p>The European Commission recently embarked on an emergency plan to cut gas usage this winter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-publishe-gas-demand-reduction-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 15 percent</a> and eventually to replace all Russian fossil fuels. Conservation and substitution measures are being rolled out and will curtail the use of gasoline, home heating, public transportation, street lighting, air conditioning and factory shifts. There will also be shelters made available to house residents in the event of gas curtailment by Russia, which has been threatened.</p>



<p>On the supply side, Germany is burning its own coal again, nuclear facilities in France and Germany will be brought out of mothballs or enlarged, and in a few years, LNG from the U.S., North Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East will permanently replace Russian gas.</p>



<p>Russia’s throttling back on gas volumes for the past year to jam up prices has provided it with additional cash flow during the war and bolstered the value of the ruble. But this benefit will be short-lived as Europe weans itself from Moscow’s fossil fuels and as punitive Western sanctions, combined with brain and capital drains, shred Russia’s economic future. More than 1,000 major Western corporations have shuttered operations there, Russian oligarchs have hidden assets and themselves abroad, and hundreds of thousands of young educated Russians, and an estimated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/13/more-than-15000-millionaires-expected-to-leave-russia-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15,000 Russian millionaires</a>, are expected to move offshore this year.</p>



<p>Bluntly speaking, Putin’s war is economic suicide. The late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once slurred Russia as being merely a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2022/05/23/latest-eu-sanctions-target-different-set-of-russias-business-elite/?sh=14e3133a290b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“gasoline station masquerading as a country,”</a> but it’s worse than that now. Putin has driven away all the gas station’s customers and employees and will be completely out of business sooner than he imagines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The State Department announced Tuesday it will provide $89 million to help demining efforts in Ukraine, comparing the scale of unexploded ordnances Russia left behind to tactics ISIS employed in Syria.</p>



<p>The funding will help set up 100 teams that can defuse and dispose of unexploded ordnances that cover an area of 160,000 square kilometers (nearly 62,000 square miles), roughly the size of Virginia, Maryland, and Connecticut combined.</p>



<p>“Russia’s unlawful and unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine has littered massive swaths of the country with landmines, unexploded ordnance, and improvised explosive devices,” the State Department said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The grotesque use of improvised explosive devices in the manner that we are seeing in Ukraine by Russian actors was previously only associated with ISIS in Syria.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The demining assistance follows an announcement Monday that the U.S. is providing $1 billion in military equipment to Ukraine, the 18th drawdown of aid and the largest package to be delivered so far, as well as $4.5 billion in economic assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The $89 million funding will also support a “large-scale train and equip project” to demine and dispose of explosive ordinances in civilian areas like farmland, and that block reconstruction efforts or prevent people from returning to their homes. </p>



<p>The State Department said that the remaining mines “continue to kill and maim innocent Ukrainian civilians.”</p>



<p>In March, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-7768aa61733dbe1f6e43358ed057371b">told the Associated Press </a>that it would take years to defuse and dispose of unexploded ordnances left behind by Russia’s invasion, that includes unexploded shells and mines and that also get trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.</p>



<p>The U.S. announcement follows an <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/3592367-russia-likely-trying-to-use-deeply-controversial-indiscriminate-mines-in-ukraine-uk-intelligence/">intelligence assessment </a>by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense on Monday that Russia is likely deploying “anti-personnel mines” in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Called the “butterfly mine,” they allegedly maimed high numbers of children in Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war between 1979 and 1989.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.K. Defense Intelligence update said that the Russians are likely deploying them to restrict freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donbas and that the mines are “deeply controversial” and that maim indiscriminately.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>Republicans are pressuring the Department of Justice to explain its rationale for executing a search warrant on former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence on Monday.  </p>



<p>House GOP leaders already skeptical of DOJ criticized the search as being politically motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), House GOP Conference Chair,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1556823412873502721?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called</a>&nbsp;the raid a “dark day in American history” and accused President Biden’s administration of “weaponizing this department against their political opponents.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News Monday night that FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland should testify to his committee on Friday, when the House will be back in session in order to act on the Democrats’ tax, climate, and healthcare reconciliation bill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) pledged “immediate oversight” of the department if Republicans win the House majority next year, directing attention at Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,”&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3593582-mccarthy-threatens-to-probe-garland-after-trump-fbi-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McCarthy said in a statement</a>&nbsp;on Monday. “Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>GOP hostility toward DOJ and the intelligence community have both been building amid Trump’s own criticism of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Republicans decried warrants that allowed the FBI to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page during the 2016 presidential campaign, with the Justice Department later&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/two-4-warrants-letting-fbi-spy-ex-trump-aide-carter-n1121406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declaring</a>&nbsp;two of the four warrants invalid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also allege a double standard, pointing to Hunter Biden’s business activities and the DOJ’s handling of the probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton having classified emails on a private server. The FBI declined to charge Clinton with any crime, and business activity of President Biden’s son is the subject of an ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not all Republicans immediately asserted, though, that the search of Mar-a-Lago was politically motivated when asking for information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Wray requesting a briefing on the warrant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat posed by any information, data, or documents in the possession of former President Trump,” Turner wrote. :Congress deserves immediate answers from you as to the actions you ordered.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Republicans in the Senate similarly called for explanations from the DOJ. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) called for the department to “quickly and transparently tell the American people who approved this raid and why it occurred.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Transparency brings accountability &amp; if the FBI &amp; DOJ aren’t transparent about raiding a former president’s [sic] home they risk further damaging their credibility,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1557000263382323200" target="_blank">tweeted</a> Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. </p>



<p>The search at Mar-a-Lago&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3594254-heres-what-we-know-about-the-fbi-search-of-trumps-mar-a-lago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be connected</a>&nbsp;to the former president’s failure to turn over some presidential records. Authorities previously retrieved boxes of documents from Mar-a-Lago that included classified information. Neither DOJ or Trump has revealed the content of the search warrant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Demands for answers stretched across a spectrum of ideological factions in the GOP, and included Republicans who Trump has politically targeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3594358-pence-demands-full-accounting-from-garland-on-mar-a-lago-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>&nbsp;that “the appearance of continued partisanship by the Justice Department must be addressed,” calling for a “full accounting” from Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Mich.), one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 attack last year, lost a primary challenge to a Trump-backed opponent last week. But he also expressed concerns about “propriety and politicization” related to the raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I will not add to baseless speculation, but Director Wray and AG Garland owe transparency on the justification for setting such a striking precedent,” Meijer&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RepMeijer/status/1557038135799943171?s=20&amp;t=LgsHehcBUpvO1TYd8tdsPQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;in a tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been noticeably absent from the GOP debate, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1557074387282677765?s=20&amp;t=WmgWVLAWpEE2180iF6P7Yg" target="_blank">declined</a> to answer a question about the raid at a press conference in Kentucky Tuesday about flooding in the state.</p>



<p>Some Republicans are reacting with caution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As opposed to rushing to judgment, the most important thing that we could do is let it play out,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said on CBS Tuesday morning, while also warning that the FBI’s credibility could be in danger if it can’t show something of “incredible magnitude” that led to carrying out the search warrant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) issued a warning for those in her party not coming to Trump’s defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you’re a Republican with any kind of voice, and not speaking up for President Trump tonight don’t expect any of us to speak up for you when your time comes. You may not realize it yet, but they’re coming for all of us,” Boebert said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/laurenboebert/status/1556795377378009092?s=20&amp;t=XuQyo62umc2qz4zYJQ_zMw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a>&nbsp;Monday night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Republican probes into the handling of the search warrant would come on top of other Congressional GOP investigations into alleged political bias in the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McCarthy has repeatedly brought up the Department of Justice’s handling of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-addresses-violent-threats-against-school-officials-and-teachers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategies</a>&nbsp;to address threats directed at school board members and teachers. House Judiciary Committee Republicans say that&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1524531031851909120/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to whistleblowers</a>&nbsp;that have contacted them, the FBI opened investigations into parents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grassley has similarly said that “multiple Justice Department whistleblowers” have approached his office about alleged political bias in the department revolving around election and campaign finance investigations and matters revolving around Hunter Biden.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>The Biden administration on Tuesday announced a new strategy to stretch the limited available doses of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine by changing how the vaccine is injected.</p>



<p>The new method would split up the doses and use one-fifth as much vaccine per shot. The partial dose of the vaccine would be injected into the upper layer of skin, rather than the full dose into the underlying fat, which is how shots are typically administered.</p>



<p>The strategy was first outlined last week by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Robert Califf, who said the intradermal injection method would allow officials to administer more shots without compromising the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine.</p>



<p>“In recent weeks the monkeypox virus has continued to spread at a rate that has made it clear our current vaccine supply will not meet the current demand," Califf said in a statement. "By increasing the number of available doses, more individuals who want to be vaccinated against monkeypox will now have the opportunity to do so."</p>



<p>In order to allow the FDA to authorize the new strategy, the Department of Health and Human Services first issued a determination allowing the agency to take emergency measures based on the information currently available about the monkeypox virus.</p>



<p>The Biden administration is scrambling to try to control the spiraling monkeypox epidemic, which has become both a political and public health concern. More than 8,900 cases have been reported, and experts think that's likely an undercount. </p>



<p>The move is aimed at alleviating a major shortage of Jynneos, the only FDA-approved vaccine for monkeypox. The administration has hundreds of thousands of doses available but will need millions in order to vaccinate everyone most at risk.</p>



<p>The Biden administration is under intense criticism for its response to the outbreak. Critics say officials were too slow to ship the vaccine that was ready to use and even slower to recognize the magnitude of the outbreak in order to get more shots ready to use.    </p>



<p>The U.S. has already purchased much of the global supply of Jynneos, but much of it is stored frozen in bulk substance at the manufacturer in Denmark. It needs to undergo a process called “fill and finish” to put the vaccine into usable vials to be shipped and then administered.</p>

<p>Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) cautioned against rushing to judgment on Tuesday following the FBI’s raid of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.</p>



<p>“This is going to raise more questions in my opinion,” <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1556988918670626817">Scott said during an appearance on “CBS Mornings"</a> to promote his book.</p>



<p>“We need to let this play out and see exactly what happens, but we should all have been stunned and surprised and shocked at what happened yesterday,” he said.</p>



<p><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3593418-fbi-raids-trumps-mar-a-lago/">Trump announced on Monday</a> that a large group of FBI agents executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, condemning the raid as political persecution.</p>



<p>Scott on CBS noted that FBI Director Christopher Wray<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3587672-watch-live-fbi-director-chris-wray-testifies-before-senate-panel/"> testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week</a>, when many Republican lawmakers critiqued the bureau for what they viewed as a political bias in the agency.</p>



<p><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3593543-republicans-erupt-over-fbis-mar-a-lago-raid/">Many Republicans are now erupting over yesterday’s raid</a> at Mar-a-Lago as the latest example, with some echoing Trump’s comparison to corruption in third-world countries. Some have called for the firing of Wray, who was nominated by Trump, and Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p>



<p>“There's been lots of questions before this raid about whether or not the FBI is doing their job apolitical, and we don’t know the answer to that question yet,” said Scott.</p>



<p>The FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) have declined to comment on the raid.</p>



<p>The raid has led to swirling speculation over the FBI’s rationale and if it will lead to eventual prosecution against Trump. Scott on Tuesday urged the public to tamp down their speculation.</p>



<p>“I think we should really, as opposed to rushing to judgment, the most important thing that we can do is let it play out,” Scott said. “Because I have no idea what they were looking for, and I don’t think anybody knows what they were looking for.”</p>



<p>Eric Trump, the president’s son, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3593896-eric-trump-fbi-mar-a-lago-search-focused-on-documents-sought-by-national-archives/">said on Fox News on Monday evening</a> that the search was focused on the handling of documents sought by the National Archives and the former president had been cooperating with federal agents for months.</p>



<p>Scott on CBS argued that the more the focus becomes on Trump, the more likely his supporters would rally around him.</p>



<p>“It has to be something of incredible magnitude for at least my side of the aisle to say that was warranted,” Scott said. “Without that, I think we're going to find ourselves in a very big mess as it relates to the credibility of the FBI.”</p>

<p>The White House said on Tuesday that President Biden learned of the FBI search of former President Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago through public reports while stressing that the Department of Justice (DOJ) operates independently of the West Wing.</p>



<p>“The president and the White House learned about this FBI search from public reports. We learned just like the American public did yesterday and we did not have advance notice of this activity,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</p>



<p>Jean-Pierre refused to comment on the DOJ investigation of Trump or the search of his home, pointing all questions to the agency.</p>



<p>“The Justice Department conducts investigations independently and we leave any law enforcement matters to them. It would not be appropriate for us to comment on any ongoing investigation,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>



<p>“The president has been has been very clear from before he was elected president and throughout his time in office that the Justice Department conducts its investigations independently he believes in the rule of law,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jean-Pierre also would not share if Attorney General Merrick Garland signed off on the raid and wouldn’t say if Biden has spoken to Garland on Tuesday. But, she said the White House has not been brief on the search operation.</p>



<p>“The president was not briefed, was not aware of it. No, no one at the White House was given a heads up. No, that did not happen,” she said.</p>



<p>The FBI search of Trump’s estate was reportedly focused on the retention of classified material. The FBI entered Mar-a-Lago after securing a search warrant from a federal magistrate judge and, while Trump wasn’t at Mar-a-Lago at the time of the search, he decried the action as politically motivated.</p>

<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Tuesday attacked a provision in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act that would significantly increase the number of agents working for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). </p>



<p>Graham <a href="https://wpde.com/watch">said at a press conference</a> with South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) that hiring 87,000 new IRS agents is “supposed to be for the rich,” but the rich have “a bunch of lawyers and accountants,” and more than half of IRS audits are conducted on people making less than $75,000 per year. </p>



<p>“If you think the federal government is out of control now, God help us when you get 87,000 new IRS agents who are looking under every rock and stone to get money out of your pocket,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graham said the new hires will expand the IRS by two and a half times. </p>



<p>The IRS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/irs-budget-and-workforce" target="_blank">employed</a><a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/irs-budget-and-workforce"> more than 78,000 people</a> during fiscal 2021, and the legislation would complete additional hires over the next 10 years, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3592694-heres-whats-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-the-sweeping-health-and-climate-bill-passed-sunday/" target="_blank">investing</a><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3592694-heres-whats-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-the-sweeping-health-and-climate-bill-passed-sunday/"> $80 million to increase enforcement</a>. </p>



<p>Graham said he will fight the proposal “tooth and nail” and attempt to redirect the funding for the IRS to immigration enforcement every year that the agency expands. He said he would like to see “a lot” more Border Patrol agents and fewer IRS agents. </p>



<p>Graham said the bill, which passed the Senate on Sunday through reconciliation after a marathon of votes on amendments, would harm South Carolina’s economy and is a “power grab in the name of climate change." He added that the legislation is a “tax-and-spend" bill at a time when the country can least afford it.</p>



<p>In addition to the IRS expansion, the $430 billion legislation includes provisions to provide tax credits to incentivize cleaner energy choices, allow Medicare to directly negotiate lower drug prices and implement a 15 percent minimum tax on the income that large corporations report to shareholders. </p>



<p>The bill passed along party lines, with Vice President Harris casting a tiebreaking vote in the 50-50 Senate. Graham said every Republican voted against it because they understood in March 2021 that it would not work. </p>



<p>The legislation is a smaller version of President Biden’s original Build Back Better proposal, a $3.5 trillion climate and social spending package that stalled last year due to opposition from moderate Democrats. </p>



<p>Graham said the “massive spending and taxes” in the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus that Biden proposed as the country sought to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic, is to blame for high inflation numbers. He said the new bill will “make everything worse.”</p>

<p>Republican Nick Begich criticized former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for leaving the state “to be a celebrity” in a new ad as the pair jostle for the state’s only U.S. House seat.</p>



<p>“I get it. Sarah Palin is famous. But come on, U.S. Congress?” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lJkI-Cf2CE">asks the ad’s narrator</a>.</p>



<p>“As governor, Palin drove oil investment out of Alaska, created our bloated state budget, quit and left Alaska to be a celebrity who didn’t want to be stuck in Wasilla,” the ad says, playing over footage of <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/487164-sarah-palin-raps-on-the-masked-singer/">Palin’s 2020 appearance on the reality singing competition “The Masked Singer.” </a></p>



<p>Begich’s team told The Hill that the ad is running statewide, but declined to comment on the cost. The Hill has also reached out to Palin’s campaign.</p>



<p>Begich and Palin have advanced, along with Independent Al Gross, to this month’s special election. The seat opened up <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/599355-alaska-sets-special-election-to-replace-late-rep-don-young/">after the March passing of Rep. Don Young (R)</a>, who had held the position for 49 years. </p>



<p>Palin was plucked from her governorship to be the Republican party’s 2008 vice presidential nominee alongside the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). The pair lost their presidential bid, and Palin resigned from the governor’s office the following year. </p>



<p>She was a supporter then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and the former president <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3257898-trump-endorses-sarah-palin-in-alaska-special-election/">endorsed her House run earlier this year</a>. </p>



<p>Trump joined Palin in a tele-rally for her campaign Monday night, following the news that the FBI <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3593418-fbi-raids-trumps-mar-a-lago/">executed a search warrant</a> against the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort, which Trump brushed off during the call as "a strange day," <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/08/trump-stumps-for-palin-on-same-day-of-fbi-search/">the Anchorage Daily News reported</a>.</p>



<p>As many as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3258113-51-candidates-running-for-alaska-house-seat/">51 candidates were in the ring to replace Young</a>, but only Begich, Palin and Gross <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-top-headlines/palin-begich-gross-advance-in-alaska-us-house-race/">advanced to the August ballot</a>. </p>



<p>Begich is the grandson of former Rep. Nick Begich, a Democrat, who was presumed to have <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/201258-begich-hearkens-back-to-his-dad-in-new-ad/">died in a plane crash 50 years ago</a>. Young went on to win his seat in a special election. </p>
