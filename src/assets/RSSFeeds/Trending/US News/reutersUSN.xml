<p>The new party, called Forward, will initially be co-chaired by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey. The new party is being formed by a merger of three political groups that have emerged in recent years as a reaction to America&#8217;s increasingly polarized and gridlocked political system.</p>

<p>Reuters <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-top-us-lng-producer-cheniere-asks-biden-admin-drop-pollution-rule-2022-07-08/?elqTrackId=E9D387FC235D43FFEFFEC66CBDF88885&amp;elqTrack=true" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed</a> Cheniere Energy has asked the Biden administration to exempt it from limits on emissions of cancer-causing pollutants, arguing they would reduce shipments from the top U.S. exporter of liquefied natural gas for an extended period and endanger the country&#8217;s efforts to ramp up supplies to Europe. The request imposes an uncomfortable dilemma on President Joe Biden’s administration as it tries to balance efforts to slash pollution from the fossil fuel industry against promises to help European allies cut energy ties with Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
